# üéì Course Enrollment System (Spring Core + JDBC)

A console-based course enrollment system built using **Spring Core** and **Spring JDBC**, designed with a layered architecture (UI ‚Üí Service ‚Üí DAO) to simulate basic university enrollment operations.

## üìñ About the Project

This Course Enrollment System was built as a **learning-focused project** to deepen my understanding of **Spring Core, Dependency Injection, and JDBC**. As a Software Engineering student, I wanted to move beyond tutorials and apply core Spring principles in a practical, real-world-style application.

The project simulates a university-like system where:
- **Admins** can manage courses, instructors, and students.
- **Students** can enroll in courses, view what‚Äôs available, and track their enrollments.

I chose a **console-based approach** to stay focused on backend logic, Spring architecture, and exception handling‚Äîwithout getting distracted by front-end concerns. This helped me practice:
- Clean code organization (DAO, Service, UI layers)
- Reusability with Spring beans
- Handling real-world exceptions in a layered application
- Working with relational databases via Spring JDBC

This project serves as the **foundation** for more complex systems I plan to build next, including full-stack web applications using **Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, and REST APIs**.
